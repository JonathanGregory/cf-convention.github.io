# 2024 CF Workshop

The 2024 CF workshop will be held at SMHI, Norrköping, Sweden (and online) from Tuesday 17th to Friday 20th September 2024.
Travel information and a link to the registration form is available on the [SMHI CF Workshop page](https://www.smhi.se/en/research/research-departments/climate-research-at-the-rossby-centre/cf-community-workshop-2024-1.207332). 

The meeting will be divided into two parts, and participants may choose to attend the first two days of the programme, the last two days, or the whole meeting, according to their own interests and availability:

 - **Part 1 (17-18 September 2024): Engaging the cross-domain CF community to gather user needs and develop a high-level CF roadmap.**
 - **Part 2 (19-20 September 2024): Detailed CF development including hackathon sessions.**

The plan for Part 1 of the workshop is to invite speakers from a broad range of CF users and potential users, for example, representatives of data producers and data archives in the earth system sciences, the health and biological research communities.

The aim is to maximise the usefulness of CF to a wide range of communities, encourage others to join and contribute to the CF community effort, and enhance interoperability with other widely used standards.
The desired outcome is a publication of the proceedings, including a roadmap for development of the CF conventions and vocabularies over the next 1 to 5 years.

Part 2 will follow the familiar format of our usual annual meeting.

**If you are interested in helping to set the meeting agenda, please [comment on this issue][ISSUE], or even join the organising committee (there's still room for more help!)**

## Documents

All the presentations and notes for the plenary and breakout sessions will be available in this [Google Drive folder]() (Not yet available).

## Preliminary Agenda

In the first part each session will begin with 1-2 short (10 - 15 min each) keynote presentations to set the scene for the conversation. In addition, there may be 1-2 brief "lightning talks" (max 5 min each) to highlight a particular perspective relevant to the conversation.

For the second part the overall aim is to have a dynamic and flexible agenda that includes a mixture of breakout group discussions and hands-on hackathons. There will be an introductory session to give an overview of outstanding issues where hackathon conveners should be prepared to give a brief introduction of each hackathon theme.
