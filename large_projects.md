# Large projects that sucessfully make use of the CF Conventions

This page lists large projects and activities that draw on the CF Conventions for metadata.
If you have any additions or corrections for this page, please submit an issue on the [CF Website GitHub repo][website-repo] (see the [Contributing Guide][website-contrib] for more details).

The description of each project and activity should give some indication of to what extent the CF conventions are used.

## Model Intercomparions Projects

Many model intercomparison projects ("MIPs") are under the auspices of the [World Climate Research Programme](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/) and supported by either of the *core projects* [Earth System Modelling and Observations (ESMO)](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/esmo-overview) and [Regional Information for Society (RIfS)](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/rifs-overview).

### CMIP - Coupled Model Intercomparion Project

The objective of [CMIP](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip) is to better understand past, present and future climate changes arising from natural, unforced variability or in response to changes in radiative forcing in a multi-model context. A specific committee, the [WGCM Infrastructure Panel (WIP)](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wip) is charged with coordinating infrastructure support for CMIP. It works with projects funded to develop software and supporting infrastructure that facilitates access to and analysis of the CMIP model output. It defines specifications and standards that ensure model output is written in a common structure and format, and that it is archived and made accessible worldwide in a common way. ***something on DRQ that provides a direct link to CF***

### CORDEX - Coordinated Downscaling Experiment

The vision of [CORDEX](https://cordex.org) is to advance and coordinate through global partnerships the science and application of regional climate downscaling of data directly from contemporary global climate models. The WCRP views regional downscaling as both an important research topic and an opportunity to engage a broader community of climate scientists in its activities. Regional climate information is more than ever needed for decision-making on societal issues such as vulnerability and adaptation to a changing climate with weather/water extremes. For infrastructure support, data and metadata standards CORDEX draws on and contributes to the work of WIP.

### Input4MIPs - Input datasets for Model Intercomparisons Project

[Input4MIPS](https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/input4MIPs/) is an activity to coordinate and make available the boundary condition and forcing datasets needed for CMIP. Various datasets are needed for the pre-industrial control (piControl), AMIP, and historical simulations, and additional datasets are needed for many of the CMIP-endorsed model intercomparison projects (MIPs) experiments.

### Obs4MIPs - Observations for Model Intercomparisons Project

[Obs4MIPs](https://www.wcrp-esmo.org/projects-and-panels/obs4mips) is an effort to make observational data more accessible for climate model evaluation, development and research. It does so by providing observational products technically aligned with climate model data.

### ISIMIP  - Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project

[ISIMIP](https://www.isimip.org)  offers a framework to compare climate impact projections in different sectors and at different scales. Consistent climate and socio-economic input data provide the basis for a cross-sectoral integration of impact projections. The focus was put on on providing cross-sectorally consistent projections of the impacts of different levels of global warming in the 21st century. The common set of scenarios made use of climate projections from five Global Climate Models (GCMs) driven by the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Thus, ISIMIP was established as a natural extension of the work done within the Coupled Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). ***Links to CF needs to be established - seems to use basic CMIP style metadata***
