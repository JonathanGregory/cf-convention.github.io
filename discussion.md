# Discussion
 
Discussion about CF Metadata takes place on GitHub in three forums, using [GitHub issues][github_issues].

*   [General discussion and standard names][github_discuss]

    For proposing standard names, asking questions or having discussions about the interpretation and use of the CF conventions, and initial suggestions for proposals to change or extend the CF conventions.

    The status of proposals about standard names that have been initiated on the general discussion forum is shown by the [CEDA vocabulary editor][vocab_editor].
  
*   [Conventions][github_conventions]

    For proposing enhancements and reporting defects in the CF conventions, that may or may not have started as conversations on the general discussion forum.

*   [Website and governance][github_website]

    For discussing, proposing changes and reporting defects in the [CF website][website], and for discussion of CF governance.

No registration with CF is required to contribute; all that is needed is a freely available [GitHub account][github].

Before the CF community migrated to GitHub, general and standard-name discussion took place on the [cf-metadata mailing list][archives], and enhancements to the conventions were proposed on the [CF Metadata Trac](Data/trac.html) site.
