## Discussion

To ask a question about how to use CF, to comment on any aspect of CF or to make a suggestion how CF could be changed or improved, please visit CF [GitHub organization Discussions][github_discussions]. There you can start a new discussion, contribute to any of the ongoing ones, and read the previous ones. Announcements about CF are made there as well.

To keep up-to-date with announcements and other discussions, go to the [`discuss` repository][github_discuss] and enable email notifications from the <svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" viewBox="-8 -8 8 8" version="1.1" width="16" data-view-component="true" class="octicon octicon-eye"><path d="M8 2c1.981 0 3.671.992 4.933 2.078 1.27 1.091 2.187 2.345 2.637 3.023a1.62 1.62 0 0 1 0 1.798c-.45.678-1.367 1.932-2.637 3.023C11.67 13.008 9.981 14 8 14c-1.981 0-3.671-.992-4.933-2.078C1.797 10.83.88 9.576.43 8.898a1.62 1.62 0 0 1 0-1.798c.45-.677 1.367-1.931 2.637-3.022C4.33 2.992 6.019 2 8 2ZM1.679 7.932a.12.12 0 0 0 0 .136c.411.622 1.241 1.75 2.366 2.717C5.176 11.758 6.527 12.5 8 12.5c1.473 0 2.825-.742 3.955-1.715 1.124-.967 1.954-2.096 2.366-2.717a.12.12 0 0 0 0-.136c-.412-.621-1.242-1.75-2.366-2.717C10.824 4.242 9.473 3.5 8 3.5c-1.473 0-2.825.742-3.955 1.715-1.124.967-1.954 2.096-2.366 2.717ZM8 10a2 2 0 1 1-.001-3.999A2 2 0 0 1 8 10Z"></path>

## Proposals to change CF
 
Proposals to change CF are discussed and decided as [GitHub issues][github_issues] in three repositories:

*   [Vocabulary][github_vocabularies]

    For proposing additions or amendments to standard names, their definitions, or other CF controlled vocabulary (area types and standardized regions).

    As well as in GitHub issues, the status of proposals about standard names is shown by the [CEDA vocabulary editor][vocab_editor]. To see a list of resolved proposals (accepted or rejected) for standard names from March 2011 onwards, click "Inactive" in the [CEDA vocabulary editor][vocab_editor]
  
*   [Conventions][github_conventions]

    For proposing enhancements and reporting defects in the CF conventions.

    Closed issues: [change agreed][github_conventions_change], [agreement not to change][github_conventions_nochange], [dormant][github_conventions_dormant] i.e. the discussion on a proposed change did not reach a conclusion. Dormant issues may be reopened if there is a new impetus or ideas that might help bring about an agreement.

*   [Website and governance][github_website]

    For discussing, proposing changes and reporting defects in the [CF website][website] or CF governance.

No registration with CF is required to contribute; all that is needed is a freely available [GitHub account][github].

## Archive links

Announcements, discussions and Q&A that were initiated _before_ CF GitHub Discussions began are continuing as [GitHub issues][github_issues] in the [`discuss` repository][github_discuss]. They will soon be converted to GitHub Discussions.

Before the CF community migrated to GitHub, general and standard-name discussion took place on the [cf-metadata mailing list][archives], and enhancements to the conventions were proposed on the [CF Metadata Trac](Data/trac.html) site.
